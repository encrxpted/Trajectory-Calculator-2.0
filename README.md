# Trajectory-Calculator-2.0
Second try for the trajectory calculator- it'll work this time, I promise...

This project is based off of the repository at https://github.com/FRC-Team-3140/TrajectoryCalculator, which was mostly the code
from https://github.com/KHEngineering/SmoothPathPlanner

I will modify this for the 2018 and 2019 FRC fields to generate a new motion profile to drive the robot autonomously
in a curve! Hopefully we can have it working this year uwu
